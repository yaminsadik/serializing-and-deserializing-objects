# serializing-and-deserializing-objects


This project demonstrates basic text serialization and deserialization in Java. It reads content from a text file, splits it into parts, serializes the parts into files, and then deserializes and prints the content back.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main classes:

1. **Main.java**: The main class that orchestrates the overall process of reading, splitting, serializing, and deserializing the text.

2. **TextFileReader.java**: A class responsible for reading the content from a text file.

3. **TextSerializer.java**: A class handling the serialization and deserialization of text.
